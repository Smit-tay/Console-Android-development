# Console-Android-development
## Adventures in developing C++ for Android from the console.

This project should serve as both a reference for newbies, and a diary of my experiences in developing a simple "Hello World" application for Android.  Along the way, I will attempt to keep this readme updated with useful information as I discover and work through problems.
